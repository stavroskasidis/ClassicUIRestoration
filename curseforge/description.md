## Options

`/fmcui` or **Options > AddOns > Forevermore Classic UI**.
`/fmcui setup` reopens the wizard.

## Known limitations

- Friendly nameplates in dungeons and raids stay modern (Blizzard locks them).

## Upgrading from Classic UI Restoration

This addon used to be called **Classic UI Restoration**. If its old
`ClassicUIRestoration` folder is still in `Interface\AddOns`, the first login
copies its settings over and disables it; delete that folder afterwards.
Without the old folder the options start from their defaults.
